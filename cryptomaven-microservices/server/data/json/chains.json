It supports smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and a broad array of token standards, including ERC-20 and ERC-721. Ethereum’s consensus mechanism transitioned from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, making it more energy-efficient. As the largest smart contract platform by market capitalization and developer activity, Ethereum remains a leader in the blockchain space.",
